# The Simulation of a Single-leg Micro-robot in V-Rep
The FinalRobot.ttt is the single-leg micro-robot model in V-Rep.

The ClockSim.ttt is a simple clock model in V-Rep.

The 290.pptx is a brief tutorial for how to use V-Rep.

The VID_20161205_140216.mp4 is a short video for the simulation.

This is a demo for how to use the xxx.ttt in V-Rep.

Required tools:
 1. V-Rep software (http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)
 
To run the project:
 1. After the V-Rep is installed, double click the xxx.ttt.
 2. Click "Simulation", then click "Start simulation".
